# 🧠 Sign Language Recognition using SVM and PCA

This project is a Sign Language recognition system built using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** combined with **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction. The interface is built using **Streamlit**, allowing users to interact with the model in a simple web app.

## 📁 Project Files

- `sign_language_SVC.py` – The **Streamlit web app** that loads the model and allows users to make predictions.
- `PCA.pkl` – The pretrained PCA object used to reduce the dimensionality of the input features.
- `sign_svmmodel.pkl` – The trained SVM model used for classifying the sign language gestures.
- `knn_model.pkl` – Trained KNN model.
- `knn_experiments.ipynb` – Notebook for KNN evaluation and testing.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model Details

- **Model Used**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Why SVM?**  
  SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is particularly well-suited for classification tasks like image recognition. It works well with small to medium datasets and handles multi-class classification using a one-vs-rest strategy.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA (Principal Component Analysis)  
  Before training, PCA was applied to reduce the number of features from 784 (28×28 pixels) to 100 components. This helps:
  - Improve model training speed
  - Reduce overfitting
  - Enhance generalization
 
    ### 🔎 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Why KNN?**  
  A simple, instance-based classifier that's easy to implement and often surprisingly effective.
   
  
- **Training Overview**:
  - Input data: 28×28 grayscale images → flattened to 784 features
  - PCA applied → Reduced to the optimal number of components (100)
  - Trained using SVM with 'C': 10, 'gamma': 'scale', 'kernel': 'rbf'
  - Final model and PCA object saved using `joblib`
    
 - ### 🔁 Ensemble Learning Experiments
  In addition to SVM and KNN, this project explores the effectiveness of various **ensemble learning methods** to enhance performance on the Sign Language MNIST dataset.

| Bagging (KNN)       | Yes         | 81%      |
| Bagging (SVM)       | Yes         | **85%**  |
| XGBoost             | Yes         | 72%      |
| Random Forest       | Yes         | 80%      |
| Stacking Ensemble   | Yes         | 73%      |

- **BaggingClassifier**: Improved accuracy by aggregating multiple estimators (KNN and SVM showed significant gains).
- **XGBoost**: Boosted performance with tuning (`max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `subsample`).
- **Random Forest**: High accuracy using 300 trees.
- **StackingClassifier**: Combined predictions from multiple models (RF, SVM, XGBoost) using Logistic Regression as a meta-learner.
